In this file I explain what changes did I do to TensorFlowTTS files and why did I do them.
*-/examples/tacotron2/conf/tacotron2.v1.yaml
in this file i changed the batch size to 16 because our V-ram couldn't handle 32 batches at once.

*-/preprocess/ljspeech_preprocess.yaml
global_gain_scale from 1 to 0.7
persian texts with fixed number of characters can produce longer voices compared to english. we change this scale to fix the problem here.

*-/tensorflow_tts/bin/preprocess.py
this is the main preprocess file. you need to change the text cleaners from english to persian for ljspeech

*-/tensorflow_tts/models/tacotron2.py
maximum lenght of our audio files is more than english files. you need to increase maximum_iterations from 2000 to 3100.

*-/tensorflow_tts/processor/ljspeech.py

there are a few things in this file that need to change in order to be compatible with persian writing.
_punctuation = "!(),.[]،؟ "
_letters = "ءآأؤئابتثجحخدذرزسشصضطظعغـفقكلمنهويًپچژکگۀی<U+200C><U+200D><U+200E>"

    cleaner_names: str = "basic_cleaners"
    positions = {
        "wave_file": 0,
        "text_norm": 1,
     }
